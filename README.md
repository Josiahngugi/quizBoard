## Getting Started
The project has two buttons "start" and "Result".upon click the "start" button an alert prompts  to the user to fill 3 sides of the triangle.
Then the program compares the sides inputed and determine the type of the triangle it is as follows to the specs
## Description
This is a web based program that determine the type of the triangle submited by the user.Its is designed using HTML,CSS,Javascript. 

## Specs of the program

    The program should return "Equilateral"
        Input: all side of triangle are equal
        Example:sides (5,5,5)
        Output : true
    The program should return "Isosceles".
        Input: Either of two triangles are equal
        Example:sides (5,5,3)
        Output: true
    The program should return "Scalene".
        Input : None of the sides is equal to the other
        Example:sides (5,6,7)
        Output :true
    The program should return "invalid".
        Input: Sum of two sides is less than one of either sides
        Example:sides (5,6,50)
        Output Example: true
## Behaviours
The "start" button loads alerts that prompt the user to put all the three sides of the triangle.Then, after comparing on values, on clicking the "Result" button its give out the result as an alert too.
